311-Chicago-Incidents Complait Administration Application
Design and implementation of a REST API to manage “311 Incidents” data openly published by the city of Chicago, IL.

Citizens can utilize the application in order to issue queries such as: find the most common service request in a specified bounding box, find the total requests per type that were created within a specified time range, find the total requests per day for a specific request type and time range, find the most common service request per zipcode for a specific day, and many more.

Citizens can upvote an existing incident, to highlight its importance. Any type of new complaint can be inserted to the database through the API, as well. 

Implementation
Flask Framework, MongoDB
