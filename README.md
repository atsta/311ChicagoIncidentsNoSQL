# 311-Chicago-Incidents Complait Administration Application

Design and implementation of a REST API to manage “311 Incidents” data openly published by the city of Chicago, IL.

API can be utilized to issue requests such as: find the most common service request in a specified bounding box, find the total requests per type that were created within a specified time range, find the total requests per day for a specific incident type and time range, find the most common service request per zipcode for a specific day, and many more.

Citizens can upvote an existing incident, to highlight its importance. Any type of new complaint incident can be inserted to the database through the API, as well.
